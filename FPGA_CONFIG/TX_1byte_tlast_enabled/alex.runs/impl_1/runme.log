WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 core_inst/eth_mac_inst/rx_fifo/fifo_inst/mem_reg_0 has an input control pin core_inst/eth_mac_inst/rx_fifo/fifo_inst/mem_reg_0/ENARDEN (net: core_inst/eth_mac_inst/rx_fifo/fifo_inst/mem_reg_0_ENARDEN_cooolgate_en_sig_6) which is driven by a register (core_inst/eth_mac_inst/rx_fifo/fifo_inst/s_rst_sync3_reg_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
