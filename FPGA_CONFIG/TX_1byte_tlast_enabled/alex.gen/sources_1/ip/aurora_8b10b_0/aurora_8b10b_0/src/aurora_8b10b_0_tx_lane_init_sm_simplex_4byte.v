//  TX_LANE_INIT_SM_SIMPLEX_4BYTE
//
//
//  Description: This logic manages the initialization of the GTX in simplex
//               4-byte mode.  It consists of a small state machine, counters
//               for tracking the progress of initializtion and detecting
//               problems, and some additional support logic.
