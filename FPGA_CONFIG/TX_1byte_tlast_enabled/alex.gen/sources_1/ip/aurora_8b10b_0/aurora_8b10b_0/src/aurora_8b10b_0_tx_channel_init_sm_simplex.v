//  TX_CHANNEL_INIT_SM_SIMPLEX
//
//
//  Description: the TX_CHANNEL_INIT_SM_SIMPLEX module is a state machine for managing channel
//               bonding and verification in simplex mode.
//
//               The channel init state machine is reset until the lane up signals
//               of all the lanes that constitute the channel are asserted.  It then
//               requests channel bonding until the lanes have been bonded and
//               checks to make sure the bonding was successful.  Channel bonding is
//               skipped if there is only one lane in the channel.  If bonding is
//               unsuccessful, the lanes are reset.The RX side indicates that bonding is complete
//               using the sideband signal TX_BONDED.
//
//               After the bonding phase is complete, the state machine sends
//               verification sequences through the channel until it is clear that
//               the channel is ready to be used.  If verification is successful,
//               the CHANNEL_UP signal is asserted.  If it is unsuccessful, the
//               lanes are reset. Verification is complete when the RX lane partner asserts the
//               sideband TX_VERIFIED signal.
//
//               After CHANNEL_UP goes high, the state machine is quiescent, and will
//               reset only if one of the lanes goes down, a hard error is detected, or
//               a general reset is requested.
//
//               This module supports 1 4-byte lane designs
