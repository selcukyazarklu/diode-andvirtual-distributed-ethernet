//  RX_LANE_INIT_SM_SIMPLEX_4BYTE
//
//
//  Description: This logic manages the initialization of the RX GTX in simplex 4-byte mode.
//               It consists of a small state machine, a set of counters for
//               tracking the progress of initializtion and detecting problems,
//               and some additional support logic.
